# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## Running the Solutions

You can run the solutions using the following command:

```sh
cargo run run --day <day><part>
```

Replace `<day>` with the day number and `<part>` with the part of the challenge (e.g., `1a` for day 1 part a).

### Examples

To run the solution for day 1 part a:

```sh
cargo run run --day 1a
```

To run the solution for day 2 part b:

```sh
cargo run run --day 2b
```

## Repository Structure

- `src/solutions`: Contains the source code for each day's challenge.
- `src/inputs`: Contains the input files for each day's challenge.
